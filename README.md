Welcome Katie Collins,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to follow along with a Code Institute video tutorial regarding the use of Git, Github, the Terminal and the Command Line.
